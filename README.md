1. Re-implement the [Bitwise Microlab](https://github.com/Zipcoder/Java-Fundamentals-Bitwise) using BitSet instead of integers.

2. Write a function that takes a BitSet and returns the number of steps needed to shift all `1` bits to the left (maintaining the same `length()` of the BitSet).

3. Write a function that takes a BitSet and returns the number of steps needed to shift all `1` bits to the right.
